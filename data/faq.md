# KritRNA – Public FAQ (Short)

## What do you do?
KritRNA develops *nonsense‑suppressor tRNA* therapeutics that can read through premature termination codons (PTCs) to restore full‑length protein production. We also build an AI/physics platform ("Translation Small‑World") for tRNA design, ranking, and validation.

## Who is this for?
Inherited diseases caused by PTCs (e.g., CFTR variants in cystic fibrosis, β‑thalassemia, and other rare disorders) where restoring translation may help. We are currently pre‑clinical and do not provide medical care.

## How is this different from readthrough drugs?
Unlike small molecules that modulate ribosomes non‑specifically, suppressor tRNAs are sequence‑directed and can be engineered to target specific stop codons while respecting conserved tRNA features for viability and safety filters.

## Do suppressor tRNAs read through normal stop codons?
Our designs are evaluated to minimize natural termination readthrough (NTC) and prioritize PTC context. We benchmark against cis‑context features and structural constraints before advancing candidates.

## Safety principles
Candidates pass baseline tRNA functionality checks (anticodon loop integrity, identity elements for aminoacylation, L‑shape folding, and conserved sites), off‑target/cis penalties, and stability screens before moving forward to wet‑lab validation.

## Access to the platform (researchers)
Researchers may request access to datasets, non‑clinical tools, or collaboration under an agreement. Commercial or clinical use is not open access.

## How can clinicians engage?
If you have a genetically confirmed PTC case, you can contact us for research collaboration interest. We cannot offer treatment, dosing, or advice. Any future trials will list inclusion criteria publicly.

## What is your competitive advantage?
1) Deep tRNA domain expertise; 2) AI‑guided design integrating folding energies, MD fluctuations, and cis‑context; 3) strict functional filters; 4) India‑centric development strategy to scale access; 5) modular validation pipeline.

## Funding and partnerships
We pursue grants and research partnerships (e.g., academia, hospitals) and plan staged fundraising. We do not discuss confidential terms over chat.

## Where are you based?
Founding work spans Germany and India with collaborators. Formal entity details and trial locations will be shared as programs mature.
